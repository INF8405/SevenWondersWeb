We acknowledge this is a copyright property of Repo production(http://www.rprod.com/). We belive this work fit
in the fair use section of the copyright laws of United State of America (github is hosted in this country). 

* Purpose: It was done as nonprofit educationnal work. We transformed the game into an electronic version.
* Nature: For an educational objective
* Amount: We use a large amount of the work (cards, civilisations, etc) but It wont make sence to use a portion 
of the game for the educational purpose
* Effect: Until now the copyright holder (repo production) has no electronic version of the game marketed. 
We didn't distributed the work on google play distrubtion network or over other means. While someone could host a game
server on his own, we beleive that there is no effect on the sales of the physical game for the 
copyright holder.
